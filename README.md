# RS3_TravMerch_Utility

This creates an application that retrieves data relevant to Runescape3's Distraction and Diversion (D&D) The Travelling Merchant.

By following the Requirements, you may retrieve the relevant data instantaneously rather than checking the Wikipedia.

ItemsDB.json ended up not being needed, just included it in-case it's helpful in future/other projects. :)
